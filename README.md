# UCLA-CS32
This repository includes my homework/project solutions for CS32 (Object-oriented Programming and Data Structures) with Prof. Nachenberg, Winter 2022.

Projects 3 and 4 were the most difficult and time-intensive, involving great use of OOP and time-efficient data structures/algorithms.

Project 3: Develop all of the classes, functions, game-logic, etc. for a simple 2D videogame using OpenGL. 
Note: I have expanded upon this project and released a playable version on itch.io which can be viewed here: https://duncand99.itch.io/super-peach-sisters

Project 4: Given a set of interface definitions, develop a "Dating App" with the following key features: 
  1. It can support a database of 100,000 members 
  2. Each member can have dozens of attribute-value pairs (ex. "Occupation" -> "Game Developer" or "Hobby" -> "Piano)
  3. Based on a given set of criteria, users should be able to quickly find and "match" with other users
  4. All matches should be ranked based upon their strength (ie compatibility between users)
